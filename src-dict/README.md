## Goal

This project provides a unique [source file](https://github.com/languagetool-org/english-pos-dict/blob/main/src-dict/src-clean.txt) and a set of scripts to maintain an English dictionary.

This text file aims to be easily readable and editable by hand. From this source file, we will generate the tagger dictionary and the spelling dictionaries (for different variants: US, GB, CA, AU, NZ, ZA) used in LanguageTool. 

## Required knowledge

Maintainers of the dictionary should be familiar with the tagging set used in LanguageTool (see the [tagset info](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/blob/master/languagetool-language-modules/en/src/main/resources/org/languagetool/resource/en/tagset.txt))

## Format 

The general format of dictionary entries is:
```
lemma=forms_and_tags=variants
```

Generally, we can write all forms of a lemma this way:
```
be=be/VB,was/VBD,wast/VBD,were/VBD,being/VBG,been/VBN,'m/VBP,'re/VBP,am/VBP,are/VBP,'s/VBZ,is/VBZ=all
```
If there is only one form for a lemma, and form and lemma are the same:
```
beautiful=JJ=all
beautifully=RB=all
beautifulness=NN:U=all
```
### Variants
Variants can be any of `us,gb,ca,au,nz,za` (comma-separated). `all` and `none` are used as shorthands for all variants or none (unclassified words).

If there are different spellings of a lemma for different variants, we can write them in the same line separated by the character `|`:

```
unrealizable|unrealisable=JJ=us,ca,gb|gb,au,nz,za
unrealized|unrealised=JJ=us,ca,gb|gb,au,nz,za
unrealize|unrealise=verb=us,ca,gb|gb,au,nz,za
```
The number of elements in the lemma separated by `|` must be equal to the number of groups in the variants. In the first example `unrealizable` will be used in variants `us,ca,gb` and `unrealisable` will be used in variants `gb,au,nz,za`.

### Nouns
To make it easier to write nouns, we use the shorthands `noun`, `noun_U` and `noun_UN`. In these cases, there will be a regular plural form generated automatically.

* `bicycle=noun=all` is equivalent to `bicycle=bicycle/NN,bicycles/NNS=all`
* `bidding=noun_U=all` is equivalent to `bidding=bidding/NN:U,biddings/NNS=all`
* `bind=noun_UN=all` is equivalent to `bind=bind/NN:UN,binds/NNS=all`

Irregular plurals (one or more) can be written this way:
```
nightwatchman [pl. nightwatchmen]=noun=all
sportsperson [pl. sportspersons,sportspeople]=noun=all
sister-in-law [pl. sisters-in-law]=noun=all
```

Regular plurals of nouns are defined in [inflection.py](https://github.com/languagetool-org/english-pos-dict/blob/main/src-dict/inflection.py).

### Verbs
Regular verbs can be written this way:
```
spot=verb=all
sprawl=verb=all
spray=verb=all
```

The regular inflection of verbs is defined in [inflection.py](https://github.com/languagetool-org/english-pos-dict/blob/main/src-dict/inflection.py). In monosyllabic verbs, the regular inflection includes the duplication of the consonant (`hug`-> `hugged`, `spot`-> `spotted`). 

In case a double consonant (or double and single consonant) is needed, use:
```
submit [-tt-]=verb=all
unfocus [-ss-,-s-]=verb=all
```
Irregular verbs can be written, with [third_person;past;past_participle;ing_form]:
```
sing [sings;sang;sung;singing]=verb=all
hide [hides;hid;hid,hidden;hiding]=verb=all
```

Verbs with variants:
```
cancel [-ll-]|cancel=verb=all|us
```
In this example, "cancelled" will be used in all variants, and "canceled" only in US variant. 

### Adjectives

```
happy-go-lucky=JJ=all
happy=happy/JJ,happier/JJR,happiest/JJS=all
```

## Adding forms only to the tagger dictionary

Sometimes it can be useful to add forms to the tagger dictionary, but we want to prevent the spelling dicts from accepting them. To do that, use "none" in the variants field:
```
prepone=verb=none # Indian English
```


## Scripts
* Script to make tests: `src-dict/check-syntax.py`
* Script to build the dictionaries: `./build-dicts-from-src.sh`
